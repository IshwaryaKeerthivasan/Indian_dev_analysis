## About the project
The Indian Development Finance Dataset contains all Indian development cooperation projects reported in
official documents of Indiaâ€™s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the Export-Import (Exim) Bank of India
between 2007 and 2014. This dataset appears to contain detailed information about Indian development cooperation projects reported between 2007 and 2014, including their locations, funding commitments, and other relevant data. This is a great resource for analyzing Indian development cooperation projects and their financial details at various levels of granularity. Here's an analysis of how India's development projects are spread across the globe. Also, it provides a detailed analysis of trends that were followed across the sectors, and how they finance in these projects throughout the year.

## Problem Definition
The project aims to analyze and understand the trends, distribution, and discrepancies between committed and disbursed funds in Indian development projects (2007-2014), evaluating sectoral priorities and geographical distribution for informed decision-making in aid allocation and management.

## Motivation
This project seeks to unravel patterns in Indian development aid to optimize resource allocation, understand sectoral priorities, and address disparities between committed and disbursed funds for more effective and impactful global development initiatives.

## Conclusion
Indian development aid is distributed across different sectors and in different locations. The "Basic Health" and "Education" sectors also received notable attention, with 110 and 45 projects, respectively. This suggests a commitment to improving healthcare and education services, which are essential components of human development. On average, the commitments made by the Indian government for development projects tend to be higher than the actual disbursed amounts. This could imply that some projects experience delays in receiving full disbursements or that there is variability in the timing of disbursements. Government agencies and organizations involved in these projects may need to ensure that they have adequate financial resources to meet their commitments and effectively manage project budgets.
